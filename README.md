Volumetric Analysis with Coordinate Transformations is a Flask web app that predicts the best coordinate system (Cartesian, Cylindrical, or Spherical) for volume integrals. It extracts equations from user queries, visualizes them in 2D/3D, symbolically computes the volume using SymPy, and displays the results interactively on a web page.

Tech used: Python 3.8+, Flask, scikit-learn, SymPy, Plotly, joblib, numpy.
